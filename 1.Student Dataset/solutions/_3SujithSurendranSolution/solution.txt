3.For a given class,find out who scored highest in english,Maths,Science

Input:- 9   (class number) hardcode this.
9:A|suraz|suraz.hadoop@gmail.com|english:90  (scored highest from both the section)
9:B|kiran|kiran@gmail.com|Maths:95
9:A|Karan|karan.@gmail.com|Science:91

*************
PIG SCRIPT
*************
student = load '/data/student-data' as
(
studentName:chararray,
studentEmail:chararray,
marks:map[],
class:chararray
);

transform = FOREACH student GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,marks, FLATTEN(STRSPLIT(class,':'));
classDetails = FOREACH transform GENERATE $0 as studentName,$1 as studentEmail,$2 as marks,$3 as class,$4 as section;
ninthStd = FILTER classDetails BY (class==9);

ScienceLang = FOREACH ninthStd GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,marks#'Science' as ScienceMark, class,section;
science = ORDER ScienceLang BY ScienceMark desc;
science_Topper = LIMIT science 1;

englishLang = FOREACH ninthStd GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,marks#'English' as EnglishMark, class,section;
english = ORDER englishLang BY EnglishMark desc;
english_Topper = LIMIT english 1;

mathLang = FOREACH ninthStd GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,marks#'Math' as MathMark, class,section;
math = ORDER mathLang BY MathMark desc;
math_Topper = LIMIT math 1;

dump english_Topper
dump science_Topper
dump math_Topper



4.Find out the class,which has better average percentage of score
for a particular class,
find out the total marks of all the students from both the section & then find the average.

ex: class 9,All students has scored 75.86% on Average and it is the highest average for any class.
9|75.86

*************
PIG SCRIPT
*************

student = load '/data/student-data' as
(
studentName:chararray,
studentEmail:chararray,
marks:map[],
class:chararray
);

avgMarks = FOREACH student GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,(int)marks#'Science' + (int)marks#'Math' + (int)marks#'English' /(float)3 as avgMark, SUBSTRING(class,0,1) as class;
grouped = group avgMarks by class;
avgClass = foreach grouped generate group,AVG(avgMarks.avgMark);
sorted = order avgClass by $1 desc;
bestStandard = limit sorted 1;
dump bestStandard;


5.Find out all weak students from each class each section as they need special attention.
A student is called as weak,if they have average of less than 60.

*************
PIG SCRIPT
*************

student = load '/data/student-data' as
(
studentName:chararray,
studentEmail:chararray,
marks:map[],
class:chararray
);

avgMarkDetails = FOREACH student GENERATE studentName,studentEmail,(int)marks#'Science' + (int)marks#'Math' + (int)marks#'English' /(float)3 as avgMark,class;
weakStudents = FILTER avgMarkDetails BY (avgMark<60);
dump weakStudents	



6.Find out the list of students who have scored more than 95 in each subject.
*************
PIG SCRIPT
*************

student = load '/data/student-data' as
(
studentName:chararray,
studentEmail:chararray,
marks:map[],
class:chararray
);
 
result = FILTER student BY (marks#'Science' > 95) AND (marks#'Math' > 95) AND (marks#'English' > 95);
dump result




7.Find out the list of students who failed in any of the 2 subject.
A student will be considered failed if he failed in atleast 2 subject.
The pass mark is 40 for any subject.
if a student scored 39,39,100 in 3 subjects,Then the average is 59.33 but still he failed.

*************
PIG SCRIPT
*************
student = load '/data/student-data' as
(
studentName:chararray,
studentEmail:chararray,
marks:map[],
class:chararray
);
 
failedStudents = filter student BY (marks#'Science' < 40 AND marks#'Math' < 40) OR (marks#'Math' < 40 AND marks#'English' < 40) AND (marks#'English' < 40 AND marks#'Science' < 40);
dump failedStudents


8.Find out the list of all the classes,where the student has scored 100 in all the subject.
  It is not necessary that a single student should score hundered.
  But all together one or other student should have score 100.

  Eg: class 9-A  Amit scored 100 in English
      class 9-A  vishal scored 100 in Maths
      class 9-B  priya scored 100 in science

We should include class 9 in  our result as we have 3 people score full marks in any of the subject.

topper = FILTER transform by (marks#'Science' == 100) OR (marks#'Math' == 100) OR (marks#'English' == 100);
grouped = GROUP topper by class 
dump grouped;
